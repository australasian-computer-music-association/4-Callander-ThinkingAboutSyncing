<p class="abstract"><em>Abstract:</em> <p>The introduction of
synchronisation (sync) to the professional toolkit of the disc jockey
(DJ) in the early 2000s proved to be controversial and divisive. Until
that point, DJs had been so focused on beatmatching—the manual process
of tempo-setting and alignment of tracks—that many dismissed sync as
‘cheating’. Concern over technology-assisted creative output is not
unique to electronic dance music (EDM). David Hockney’s investigation
into the use of optical aids by the Old Masters highlighted similar
perspectives in visual art. As sync has simplified some of the
mechanical aspects of DJing, DJs have shifted away from building sets by
sequencing pre-recorded audio made by other music producers towards an
approach that incorporates improvisatory composition and production.
Through a process of reflective practice and critical review of
technique and repertoire both pre- and post-sync, this paper discusses
how technology shapes and informs the realisation of a DJ set,
highlighting how sync has catalysed a disconnect between the performer,
their gestures, the source material and audiences, necessitating a
rethink on how we demonstrate and recognise technical virtuosity in
performance. This paper concludes by arguing that virtuosity in modern
DJing is primarily a product of instrument configuration and
pre-production, an amalgamation of formerly distinct production and
performance techniques, and identifies how sync’s affordances might
inform future views on DJ practice and the presentation of EDM.</p></p>
<h1 data-number="1" id="introduction"><span
class="header-section-number">1</span> Introduction</h1>
<p>In a packed nightclub, DJ Davvincii appears, arms spread wide as the
crowd chants his name. He theatrically lowers a finger to start the
music, immediately sending the audience into a frenzy. Members of the
audience proclaim, “I love you, Davvincii,” “<em>this</em> is music” and
“he’s the king!” while the DJ finds time to fry an egg, play Jenga, draw
a self-portrait, swipe credit cards, play computer games, operate a
miniature train set and more. When he feigns a heart attack, the tension
is palpable, but the DJ miraculously recovers, finally striking the
oversize button marked BASS to set forth an apocalyptic response. The
performance, part of a Saturday Night Live (SNL) skit from 2014,
presents a comic take on a commonly-held mainstream trope about
21<sup>st</sup> century DJ practice; one in which the craft and skill of
DJing can be automated and distilled down to a single button. Andy
Samberg’s portrayal of DJ Davvincii and the response of his adoring fans
highlights the growing disconnect between performer, repertoire and
audience caused by disruptive technologies.</p>
<p>Canadian DJ Deadmau5, a notable artist in the <em>real</em> world of
EDM, sparked controversy by admitting that “we all hit play” (Zimmerman
2012). For Deadmau5, virtuosity is demonstrated in the studio, while
beatmatching—tempo-setting and aligning tracks<a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>—can
be handled by technology. A central argument in this paper is that
beatmatching and its automation through sync therefore sits at the
centre of discourse on virtuosity and authenticity in 21<sup>st</sup>
century DJing. In the pre-digital era, that virtuosity was more easily
identified: audiences heard and saw DJs playing records and could
directly connect performance gestures that caused shifts in timing or
pitch—furious backspins, or scratching back and forth. DJs further
demonstrated authenticity through “digging” i.e. procuring rare and
exclusive records and amassing enormous record collections.</p>
<p>As vinyl gave way to digital audio, first through the introduction of
the CD format and then through digital audio files, the process of
collecting and handling music was made invisible, replaced by a panoply
of knobs, buttons and blinking lights (Butler 2014, p. 1) that might not
bear any obvious connection to the music played. By 2008 and armed with
sync, Canadian DJ Richie Hawtin had abandoned turntables and
beatmatching in pursuit of “something else” (Gholz 2011, p. 59), playing
digital audio and loops on four virtual decks using Traktor Pro DJ
software. He has since expanded further, incorporating modular
synthesizers, sequencers and effects into his DJ sets.</p>
<p>In 2012 Pioneer DJ released the CDJ2000NXS, a standalone but
network-connectable digital turntable that appealed to DJ approaches old
and new. On one hand offering tactile control of digital files akin to
handling records, and on the other offering a button marked SYNC, which
put automated beatmatching within arm’s reach of all DJs except the
vinyl purist. Other affordances, such as quantized looping and immediate
file transferability, presented DJs with a compelling case to abandon
vinyl.</p>
<p>In 2011, Attias used the term “formatism” to explain a DJ’s
preference for vinyl over digital audio via CDs, WAV files or MP3s,
arguing that “anxiety over formats in DJ culture marked a 'crisis of
identity’ that was mediated by discourses of <em>virtuosity</em> and
<em>authenticity</em>” (emphasis Attias 2013, p. 17). Attias articulated
two areas where these aspirations are accompanied by anxieties that
“continue to animate current controversies in DJ culture […]: a concern
that new technologies degrade the fidelity of musical recordings and a
concern that they undermine the development of musical technique” (2013,
p. 21).</p>
<p>It is no surprise that many vinyl DJs considered sync and digital
audio a threat to the craft; product developers pursued a workflow where
beatmatching’s “cognitive load is heavily reduced” (Anderson 2005), and
resistance came from both practitioners and academics. Mills suggested
that DJing might become “nothing more than a button any promoter can
push” (2013), while van Veen and Attias (2011) lamented that “the role
of the DJ as human agent of music selection has been removed completely
now.”</p>
<p>This correlates to a shift by DJs toward the laptop, an instrument
used to produce music, prepare for a set, and to simultaneously play and
record a performance, with much of this work invisible to the audience.
Accordingly, Montano argued for a revised view on how authenticity and
skill was recognised, suggesting that “with the increasing use of CDs,
mp3s and computer programs such as Ableton Live, the notion that vinyl
and turntables represent the authentic technology of DJ culture seems
somewhat redundant” and that "there needs to be a redefinition of the
concept of DJing and a reframing of the skills and abilities seen as
being essential to DJ practice” (2010, p.397).</p>
<p>Regardless of the DJ’s choice to beatmatch by hand or by sync, from
an outsider’s perspective, the set—the culmination of DJ curation and
programming—has barely changed since the 1970s. The audio remains a
collection of tracks, summed and arranged in long form with the
intention of minimising distinctions and maintaining continuity. Many
patrons cannot detect whether they are experiencing the nuances of
manual, human beatmatching or the precision of automated sync, and SNL’s
representation of adoring EDM fans suggests that plenty do not care.</p>
<p>Sync presents an opportunity to move the DJ craft beyond its two-deck
conventions: more precise mixing; more channels, and new instruments
brought together in ways that were previously impossible. In so doing,
adding these new layers of control and automation can “obfuscate and
distend the moment of creation, making it more difficult for audiences
to connect what they see on stage with what they hear” (McAlpine 2019,
pp. 189-190). The risk is that by characterising DJ performance as did
the SNL sketch, the craft of the DJ is reduced to the press of a magic
button; EDM audiences are considered gullible, and DJs are considered
cheats.</p>
<p>Hawtin hardly seeks a reduced cognitive load, however; his setup
incorporates new instruments and techniques across the six-channel<a
href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> Model 1 mixer that he helped to
design. Before 2001, DJs could not have imagined a performance on six
channels, but with the cognitive load historically devoted to
beatmatching now freed up, modern DJs can move beyond connecting the
“intro” and “outro” sections of existing tracks to be more creative with
the underlying materials. This continues a tradition established in the
early 1970s by DJs like Nicky Siano, who in 1973 began playing on three
turntables instead of two (Shapiro 2005, pp. 37-38). Siano made drastic
temporal changes to records to make them fit into his sets and used
duplicate records to piece together new arrangements. He was “not so
much playing records as making music” (Lawrence 2003, p. 107).
Nevertheless, until the turn of the century, the DJ’s standard
“two-deck” performance configuration had barely changed, and as a
result, neither had the form and structure of the DJ set. Much of the
craft of DJing was devoted to cueing up and handling the transitions
between vinyl records, and virtuosity was measured by the number of
simultaneous tracks a DJ could handle; by the late 1990s, “three deck
wizards” like Mills were considered virtuosi (Butler 2006, p. 52;
Reynolds 1998, pp. 272-273). Overall, it was the introduction of new
digital technologies—primarily MP3 files, digital controllers and
sync—that enabled DJs to overcome the tactile and cognitive limitations
of traditional DJ performance and to routinely play and manipulate
multiple tracks in real-time. As a consequence, the practice and the
output of DJing, and the notion of what constitutes virtuosic DJ
technique has changed.</p>
<p>This paper argues that sync continues the tradition of digital
disruption and extends it to consider the impact not only on music
performance, but on notions of authenticity and virtuosity.
Investigating the work of DJs such as Hawtin and Mills and the author’s
own practice pre- and post-sync, it draws parallels between the
DJ-centric discourse on sync and David Hockney’s enquiry into the use of
optics by the Old Masters of painting and drawing. Hockney’s
practice-led research methodology allowed him to chart historical trends
in technology-assisted technique, and then to identify where artists
rejected precision and departed from that trend. Similar insights
emerged through the author’s own performance design for a sync-driven
work entitled <em>Real Time, Online</em> (2020).</p>
<p>This paper concludes that rather than reducing the cognitive load of
DJ work, sync represents an opportunity to expand the DJ craft to
incorporate new instruments and new techniques—including those
previously viewed as the domain of producers (studio <em>makers</em>
rather than <em>performers)</em>—for combining pre-recorded audio with
real-time composition.</p>
<h1 data-number="2" id="a-selected-history-of-disruption"><span
class="header-section-number">2</span> A Selected History of
Disruption</h1>
<p>When the Beatles released <em>Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club
Band</em> in 1967, the pop world realised that “performances and records
were not necessarily linked” (Moorefield 2010, p. 55). The album was the
product of 700 studio hours of “almost continuous” technological
experimentation (Tingen 2017). The production’s final touches involved
“the taping of nonsense gibberish that they had decided to cut into
pieces, stick together at random and play backwards before putting it in
the concentric run-out groove of side two”<a href="#fn3"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>
(Julien 2008, p. 7). Pierre Schaeffer was the first to exploit
disc-based audio looping and performance on multiple turntables—using
shellac records to create what he called “closed grooves” (Schaeffer
1952, 32-36)—an approach that would be revisited by Techno producers
playing vinyl in the 1990s.</p>
<p>In the 1980s, the UK Musicians’ Union expressed concern that Gary
Numan’s synthesizer music was “putting proper musicians out of work”
(Whalley 2009, 41:30), echoing the sentiment that radio DJs in 1920s USA
were putting live musicians out of work (Brewster &amp; Broughton 2006,
p. 33). Simon Frith’s commentary on disruptions caused by drum machines
succinctly articulated the problem of human-machine interfacing more
broadly: “It reflects [the] belief that the drummer is a musician in a
way that the drum-machine programmer is not” (1986, p. 265). Other
electronic instruments, such as the Fairlight CMI, “[gave] rise to the
new types of practitioner, such as the ‘programmer’” (Marrington 2020,
p. 718).</p>
<p>In Detroit in 1992, Mills asked his record cutting engineer, Ron
Murphy, to cut circular grooves on one side of a double-LP release
(Mills, Banks &amp; Hood 1992) to look like The Rings of Saturn. Where
The Beatles had added looped, layered, and reversed outtake chatter from
the band’s studio sessions (Lewisohn 1989, 109), Mills at first sought a
visual effect. Murphy experimented further to add audio to the grooves
(Zlatopolsky 2015). At a fixed tempo, 133.33 beats per minute (BPM), and
with the record spinning at 33.33 revolutions per minute (RPM), he
discovered a workable method for creating endless musical loops of 1.8
seconds duration, where the downbeat of one musical bar synchronised
perfectly with each revolution of the record. In DJ circles these
concentric loops became known as locked grooves (LG).</p>
<p>Historically, DJs played commercial releases that were first arranged
and mixed in the studio, then mastered and manufactured before being
played live. The DJ’s pursuit of a continuous mix in these settings
informed the structure of the tracks: producers made “DJ friendly”
arrangements that would build gradually with an “intro” and then end
with an “outro” (Rietveld 2011, pp. 6-7) to combine “the functions of
textural decrescendo and closing within a single section” (Butler 2006,
p. 224). Conventions for arranging intersected with conventions for
two-deck DJ performance, where DJs moved back and forth between records
on Deck A and Deck B, waiting patiently until “safe” points in an
arrangement to execute transitions without incident. The risk of
superimposed tracks playing out of time (a “trainwreck”) imparts a
degree of risk upon any extended overlay, making a two-turntable
performance configuration enough for most DJs working un-synced. In
pursuing continuity most DJs <em>do</em> seek convenience, an
observation that emboldened Deadmau5 in asserting that “beatmatching
isn’t even a skill” (Zimmerman 2012).</p>
<p>With audio materials reduced to short loops running at a fixed tempo,
DJs such as Mills and Hawtin used new performance approaches and formats
such as the LG to challenge the form of EDM. Assembling loops in
real-time facilitated a more fluid and flexible movement between tracks
(or <em>less-than-tracks</em> – shorter loops created with the intent of
bridging transitions, creating breaks or providing textural layers<a
href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>) played simultaneously. Mills’ live
recording from a Japanese nightclub <em>Live At The Liquid Room –
Tokyo</em> (1996) distributes excerpts of his three-deck performance
across a CD release in segments. “Segment 2” includes thirteen tracks<a
href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> in just under twenty-four minutes,
including the Mills original “Loop 3,” a locked groove hardly
distinguishable from the other loop-based arrangements played in Mills’
set. Although LGs are also necessarily mastered and cut to vinyl, this
short format brought Mills a step closer to merging his production and
performance practices by deferring any arranging until the moment of
performance.</p>
<p>Despite his prior challenge to EDM form through looping LGs and
loop-based studio arrangements, Mills did not seize the opportunity to
merge production and performance through the exploitation of sync.
Rather, he rejected it with the boldest of statements:
<em>Exhibitionist</em> (2004), a DVD mix compilation that celebrated the
manual technique—and the potential for error—of the Techno DJ. Amidst a
market of carefully curated DJ mix CDs assembled with precision, this
was a bold statement of “warts and all” DJing (Finlayson 2015). Within
the first two minutes, Mills arguably makes enough “mistakes” to
convince any novice to stop the mix and start over. The result of Mills’
rhythmic drifting and shifting is reminiscent of Steve Reich’s <em>Piano
Phase</em> (1967), a work that was itself inspired by experiments with
tape: <em>It’s Gonna Rain</em> (1965); and <em>Come Out</em> (1966).
Mills’ rejection of the affordances of 21<sup>st</sup> century
performance technologies echoes that of Paul Cézanne’s response to the
photographic technologies that emerged in the 1870s and the optical aids
that preceded them, as discussed in the next section.</p>
<p>Once Hawtin began using software in performance, his works
transformed completely. This is evident between his mix CDs <em>Decks
EFX &amp; 909</em> (1999) and <em>DE9 Transitions</em> (2005):
software-based synchronisation replaced manual beatmatching, arranged
tracks no longer represented the building blocks of a set. Hawtin either
reduced these blocks to short loops in advance, or he applied EQ and
filters to strip tracks down to their rhythmic skeleton, not unlike the
work of a Dub producer extracting a rhythm from a reggae song (Veal
2007, p. 48).</p>
<p>The loops and stems created as a product of this process were woven
back together in a tapestry of “six, seven, even 10 primary sources”
(Loftus 2005). Effectively Hawtin created <em>remixes</em> of works by
other artists, then assembled these new productions in a DJ mix. By the
time <em>DE9: Transitions</em> was released in 2005, his blends were so
elaborate that each of the twenty-eight tracks was attributed to Hawtin
as the original artist, though not without credit to the artists from
whom he sampled. That this process might be characterised as
<em>sampling</em> rather than simply <em>playing tracks</em> shows how
the work relied on studio processes as much as performance techniques,
facilitated by a common instrument deployed to both pursuits: the
laptop.</p>
<p>For the 21<sup>st</sup> century DJ, technology has eased the
mechanical burden of creating new works, and though some practitioners
and observers might consider this “cheating,” this affords the adopters
of such technologies an opportunity to incorporate new elements of
performance into their craft. Technology does not equate to a shortcut,
but a facilitator and redistributor of effort. This has direct parallels
in other areas of creative practice.</p>
<h1 data-number="3" id="david-hockneys-secret-knowledge"><span
class="header-section-number">3</span> David Hockney’s Secret
Knowledge</h1>
<p>After visiting an exhibition of nineteenth century portraits by
Ingres at London’s National Gallery in 1999, David Hockney began drawing
with an optical device called the camera lucida (Hockney 2006, p. 12),
eventually leading him to pursue a visual argument that “from the early
fifteenth century Western artists had not just been aware of, but had
relied on optics to create”living projections”” (Bolt 2010, p. 28). His
theory was met with resistance by colleagues and contemporaries: “their
main complaint was that for an artist to use optical aids would be
‘cheating’; that somehow [Hockney] was attacking the idea of innate
artistic genius” (Hockney 2006, p. 14).</p>
<p>Hockney’s research enquiry was itself assisted by technology:
affordable colour photocopying. After creating a wall of reproduced
images that was “seventy feet long and covered five hundred years more
or less chronologically” (Hockney 2006, p. 16), he could not only view
the works side by side, but could arrange a timeline to view the history
of visual art as it intersected with technologies that emerged to
challenge or assist it. This included lenses used by the Old Masters
since 1430, and “the invention that fixes the lens image with chemicals
(photography) doing away with the need for the artist’s hand altogether”
in 1839 (Hockney 2006, pp. 184-185).</p>
<p>In his broad overview, Hockney charts artists and their output with a
green line that runs parallel to a red line representing technology
(2006, pp. 184-185). Where the green line shows the work of
Michelangelo, for example, he is seen to depart from the red line
(electing not to use optics), but remains relatively close, due to the
influence of other practitioners and works. In the 1870s, once
photography had become more widespread and people had become more
exposed to its realism, artists such as Cézanne departed much further,
and after four centuries of realism, “awkwardness” returned (2006, p.
185). Hockney demonstrates this awkwardness by displaying Caravaggio’s
1597 work, <em>Basket of Fruit</em> next to Cézanne’s 1878-79 painting,
<em>Apples</em> (2006, pp. 188-189). It is no surprise that Caravaggio’s
position on the green line touches the red line that represents
technology; the precise detail in his fruit is almost photographic,
especially next to Cézanne’s awkward apples that appeared after
photographic perfection could be achieved with a camera. Hockney’s
argument was not that one work is more skilled than the other, but that
our understanding of how each work was created can be advanced through
more focused research – why didn’t Cézanne use optics?</p>

</figure>
<p>This kind of enquiry allows us to better understand why artists
deploy different techniques and media: Cézanne’s decision to “eyeball” a
subject asserts an artistic view that transcends realism. To draw this
back to DJ practice, consider Mills’ approach to beatmatching:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>I'll let it fall off a little bit before you hear it, so you can
feel it coming together. Because, you know, we're dealing with people,
and people are not machines. Perfection is not always the point […] If
you never let the audience hear that, then they might believe that
you're perfect, and that you mix like a computer, like software</em>
(2019).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even when DJs elect not to utilise sync, they operate amongst a field
of practitioners for whom it is widely available, just as the Old
Masters “would have seen paintings and drawings made with [optics], and
maybe even some projections themselves (to see optical projections is to
use them); and as apprentices they probably copied works with optical
effects” (Hockney 2006, p. 17). In EDM, where precise, sync-driven
transitions have become increasingly commonplace, the audience might
expect precision from performers who choose not to use the technology.
Still, just as Cézanne did not seek high resolution perfection in his
execution of <em>Apples</em>, performers such as Mills favour the
imperfection of manual assembly—micro-timing between discrete rhythms,
alignments pursued in real-time and by feel—over the precision of
sync.</p>
<p>Despite its precision, there are limitations and skills inherent in
using sync, many of which are yet to be fully investigated. Consider
Hockney’s comment on the use of optical aids: “let me say here that
optics do not make marks, only the artist’s hand can do that, and it
requires great skill. And optics don’t make drawing any easier, either,
far from it – I know, I’ve used them” (2006, p. 14). Bolt reviewed
Hockney’s drawings with and without optics: “the line was much surer and
more confident than the”groping lines” of a drawer struggling to “see”
and record freehand. However, in this confidence it lacked the struggle,
the variation in line quality and indeterminacy of the eyeballed
drawing” (2010, p. 28).</p>
<p>In DJ performance, the difference between the sure hand of sync and
the groping lines of manual assembly is worth exploring. Mills must work
harder for every alignment between tracks, and in so doing generates a
sonic outcome characterised by variation and indeterminacy that is, for
many listeners, more appealing than the rigidity and confidence of a
sync-driven Hawtin set.</p>
<h1 data-number="4"
id="analysis-of-pre--and-post-sync-technique-and-repertoire"><span
class="header-section-number">4</span> Analysis of pre- and post-sync
technique and repertoire</h1>
<p>The differences between a synced Hawtin and an un-synced Mills, and
between Caravaggio and Cézanne—utilising technology for precision in
creative practice or rejecting it—are evident in a side-by-side viewing
of two performance works by the author. The first is <em>Honkytonks: The
Last Dance</em> (2006) (<em>TLD</em>), a vinyl-only set performed with
two Technics SL1210 turntables and a two-channel Pioneer DJ mixer. This
was released globally as a DJ mix CD, a format since superseded by
online radio streaming and podcasting. The second is <em>Real Time
Online</em> (2020) (<em>RTO</em>), an audio-visual (AV) performance
using Ableton Live on an Apple MacBook Pro and a six-channel Model 1
mixer. This was transmitted via Facebook Live during the Covid-19
pandemic. The following section describes pre-production, performance
design, and examples of DJ mix transitions in <em>The Last Dance</em>
and <em>Real Time Online</em>, then discusses how they each embody
different facets of virtuosity and authenticity.</p>

<p>The work of curating and then performing this mix was punctuated by
months spent in front of spreadsheets and emails: licensing deals were
negotiated with producers and labels, permissions granted, and a
shortlist approved. This represented a commitment to digging that moved
beyond finding records to securing the rights to combine and re-record
them. Once opening and closing tracks were selected, the planned
transitions between tracks were rehearsed in an effort to map out a
musical trajectory for the set. In the years after digital DJ devices
emerged, authenticity was front of mind for both audiences and
performers, and so the decision to perform the set using vinyl, and to
record the mix in a single take without further editing was a commitment
to the history of the DJ craft. The CD liner notes for <em>TLD</em>
proudly announced: “these are real turntable mixes, using vinyl, two
Technics SL1210s and a mixer” (Callander &amp; Chabdjian 2006). This
echoed the sentiment of rock bands that explicitly asserted their
authenticity: Queen plastered a statement on their 1970s albums that
read “no synthesizers!” (Milburn 2013, 112); and Rage Against The
Machine proclaimed that "no samples, keyboards or synthesizers [were]

<h2 data-number="4.3" id="execution"><span
class="header-section-number">4.3</span> Execution</h2>
<p>In <em>TLD,</em> a cautious approach to live DJ performance is
evident from the outset. After four minutes of the first track,
Jackmate’s <em>80SC7SEQ</em> (Baumann 2003), Hervé AK’s <em>Serial
X</em> (Hervé 2006) blends in smoothly (<a
href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5574244">Transition 1A</a>). The
sparse outro of the former allowed for the alignment of the two without
the need to adjust the mixer’s equalisation and volume. When the first
track entered its sparser outro phase, the transition became a matter of
maintaining alignment. Within a minute, only <em>Serial X</em> was
audible—not a quick mix à la Mills, but a safe one. The set progresses
in a similar vein, the DJ barely intervening in the arrangements as they
had been cut to vinyl, instead focusing his attention on the transitions
between tracks. With two records spinning, the tempo had to be set by
ear; analogue turntables lack the precise tempo readings that are
presented by digital decks in decimal increments. Every suspended
overlay represented a risk to the performance and required continual
adjustment.</p>
<p>As the set continues, the mixing becomes more cautious as the DJ aims
for safe transitions to avoid an audible trainwreck from derailing the
recorded performance to that point. The boldest interruptions amount to
little more than early exits from tracks, the DJ preferring the
performative safety of leaving a single track in play without creating
an audible chasm of frequency, rhythm or volume (<a
href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5574244">Transition 1B</a>).
Occasionally an opportunity presented to exit a track earlier than at
the outro. During a short break around halfway into <em>No Matter
Whether</em> (Scasacia 2005), the mix switched quickly to the beatless
intro section of <em>Bildeburg Group</em> by Konrad Black and David
Brown (2006) (<a
href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5574244">Transition 1C</a>). This
transition capitalised upon energetic shifts happening on an intra-track
basis: the ambient introduction to <em>Bildeburg Group</em> provided a
sense of drama in an otherwise continuous flow of forward-moving,
minimalist Techno; the short break in <em>No Matter Whether</em>
represented an opportune moment to switch between two beatless
sections.</p>
<p>The DJ’s part in the process really <em>was</em> that of a disc
<em>jockey</em>—<em>riding</em> the forward motion of these records and
switching from one to the other, but without generating energy that was
distinct from the tracks as they had been produced. Aside from deciding
which track to play when, at what pace and for how long, the DJ
technique had little impact on the sound or shape of each record. The DJ
selected, presented, and blended works by other producers, but did not
produce or compose.</p>
<h2 data-number="4.4" id="authenticity-and-virtuosity-before-sync"><span
class="header-section-number">4.4</span> Authenticity and virtuosity
before sync</h2>
<p><em>TLD</em> prioritised mixing <em>live</em> to capture the
recording in a single take and on <em>vinyl only</em> as a matter of
artistic choice. Though the setup was not dissimilar to that used by
Mills in 2004 (two turntables rather than three, plus a mixer), the
digital precision that emerged in other performances around that time,
especially from Hawtin, had evidently influenced the set. To achieve
Hawtin’s digital precision at the frequency of Mills’ vinyl execution is
beyond the reach of most DJs. Accordingly, the performance was executed
with caution, seeking a comparable precision but without using the
technologies that could guarantee it. Though this approach resisted
emerging digital technologies, it lacked the confidence of Mills or
Cézanne in celebrating the awkwardness inherent in that choice;
virtuosity was a matter of minimising mistakes in the pursuit of
flawless technical execution.</p>
<p>In recording <em>TLD</em>, virtuosity was further displayed through
curatorship and programming: tracks were selected carefully, arranged in
order, and then assembled without technical incident. In spruiking the
releases, the matter of authenticity was addressed by emphasising that
the mix had been recorded without any post-performance editing. As the
set was executed without any studio tricks, it was <em>real</em> DJing,
an honest representation of how the set would be performed live. This
approach is embedded with nostalgia, more like a direct-to-disc
recording of Frank Sinatra and his orchestra in the 1940s-1950s (Granata
2004, pp. 37-38) than <em>Sgt. Pepper</em>’s 700 hours of production
using multi-track tape.</p>
<h2 data-number="4.5" id="real-time-online"><span
class="header-section-number">4.5</span> Real Time, Online</h2>
<p><a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5574244">Full Set (2)</a></p>
<p><em>Real Time, Online</em> deployed a modern approach to DJing that
was inspired by the LG format discussed earlier: un-arranged, loop-based
tracks were assembled in real-time. Performed across six channels and
held together by sync, records and turntables were replaced by three
channels of pre-recorded audio and accompanied by three more channels of
electronic instruments. In June 2020, with support from the City of
Melbourne’s <em>Covid-19 Quick Response Arts Grants</em>,<a href="#fn6"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> the
set premiered via Facebook Live. The funding proposal demonstrated how
ideas for the craft had changed: “real time audio and video synthesis
merges with the artist's own form in a multimedia broadcast that cannot
be replicated and will exist only online.” Authenticity in this
performance was not connected to format or curatorship, but to time and
place: the combined sum of pre-recorded audio and improvised
accompaniment would be unique to the moment of assembly. The intent for
<em>RTO</em> was to push the boundaries of DJing as far as possible, as
Hawtin inferred, allowing the DJ to do “something else” (Gholz 2011,
p. 59).</p>
<h2 data-number="4.6" id="pre-production-1"><span
class="header-section-number">4.6</span> Pre-Production</h2>
<p>Most of the audio used in <em>RTO</em> was recorded at Melbourne
Electronic Sound Studio (MESS), in front of unfamiliar instruments such
as Moog’s System 55 or Buchla’s 200 modular system, with their audio
output routed into Ableton Live. With recording enabled, sampling,
re-sampling, and programming began immediately. Passages of audio were
duplicated, edited, looped, and layered alongside subsequent overdubs.
The new ideas that emerged through that process were saved as versions,
leaving the previous session intact and creating a new virtual sketch.
The best of these were rendered as audio and distributed across three
tracks in a new Live set, and then routed into respective stereo
channels of the Model 1 mixer.</p>
<p>Working in threes facilitated a performance approach somewhere
between “we all press play” and a more fluid improvised assembly. It
enabled moving from one piece of recorded audio to the next as any
traditional DJ might, but it also enabled the exploitation of
opportunities afforded to DJs through powerful DAWs in the
21<sup>st</sup> century—duplicated audio signals, looping, and an
expanded track count. Through this workflow, the un-arranged studio-made
track was treated as a flexible building block for mixing in multiple
directions, rather than a destination reached via typical mix
transitions from one track to another.</p>
<h2 data-number="4.7" id="execution-and-analysis"><span
class="header-section-number">4.7</span> Execution and analysis</h2>
<p>Ableton Live was used to track the playback of audio clips alongside
summed audio that had been routed back into Live’s Arrangement View,
while a video camera documented the performance. This enabled review of
the set’s inputs and outputs simultaneously on a shared timeline, and
correlation between performance gestures and sonic outcomes. The visual
timeline below shows which tracks were introduced, when, and for how
long.</p>

<p>The CD liner for Hawtin’s <em>Decks EFX &amp; 909</em> (1999)
presented a similar view of DJing that departs from typical Deck A to
Deck B programming; this demonstrates Hawtin’s early interest in
sync-enabled multi-channel performance. Rather than one complete track
transitioning to another, this was a more elaborate deconstruction and
reassembly of tracks, with a less obvious delineation between one and
the next, and less adherence to the outro-intro conventions of DJing
with commercial releases.</p>

class="header-section-number">4.8</span> Deconstructing a modern
mix</h2>
<p>At the beginning of <em>RTO</em> it took more than nine minutes
before the first track, “Moog Modular 3.2,” was audibly removed from the
mix, though any listener could be forgiven for missing the point where
it dissolved over time. “Jupiter 6 ALT 3 Hypnogroove” was introduced at
00:04:07, but it was not until 00:09:34 that the first track had
disappeared completely (<a
href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5574244">Transition 2A</a>).
Fluidity was the objective, as it was for Hawtin’s <em>DE9</em> trilogy
(1999; 2001; 2005). Across three channels, and with various clips
representing partial deconstructions of two original works, the summed
audio transformed gradually over time. This approach to assembling
tracks was continued throughout the hour-long performance.</p>

<p>The process of moving from one track to the next represented a kind
of homogenisation between works. If part of one track stood out from the
other, it was equalised or filtered, or its volume was lowered, until at
the mixer it became difficult to determine the origin of each sound.
With sync mitigating the risk of a trainwreck, the DJ’s cognitive
function could be directed towards the blend of frequencies and
amplitudes, rather than towards rhythmic alignment. While a blend
between tracks was pursued in both the pre- and post-sync performances,
in this performance the blends were more gradual, more layered, and more
precise (<a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5574244">Transition
2B</a>).</p>
<h2 data-number="4.9" id="authenticity-and-virtuosity-after-sync"><span
class="header-section-number">4.9</span> Authenticity and virtuosity
after sync</h2>
<p>Virtuosity in <em>RTO</em> was not displayed through tactile
handling, but through performance configuration and pre-production; as
Deadmau5 explained: “my”skills” and other PRODUCER’S skills shine where
it <em>[sic]</em> needs to shine: in the goddamned studio” (2012.
Emphasis Zimmerman).</p>
<p>Skill in <em>RTO</em> was demonstrated through the design of a custom
instrument that was configured to play exclusive music—routing discrete
audio outputs from Ableton Live through a Model 1 mixer departs
significantly from two-deck conventions—and because the DJ’s handling of
the music was unique to that performance. It was not necessary to
demonstrate visible tactile control over the alignment of tracks,
instead tracks that had never been heard were composed on the fly. DJ
performance and studio production were amalgamated.</p>
<p>Armed with a suite of original and exclusive audio and engaged in a
newly-combined practice between studio and stage, the DJ did not need to
dig for records, nor seek permission to use them. From start to finish,
this set belonged to the DJ; authenticity was demonstrated through the
scope of the work and an expansion of technical skills. Authenticity and
virtuosity were intertwined, but in a manner different to that advanced
by Attias (2013, p. 17): the performance was realised entirely through
the work of a solo practitioner using new tools, such as Ableton Live
instead of turntables, distinct from the fourteen studio producers and
one performing DJ involved in the execution of <em>TLD</em>.</p>
<h1 data-number="5" id="conclusion"><span
class="header-section-number">5</span> Conclusion</h1>
<p>This paper began by highlighting the disruptive effects of sync.
Automating the work of beatmatching led to a conceptual divide between
those who view DJing as being inextricably linked to the tactile craft
of playing records, and those who see the DJ as a practitioner that
works on producing, arranging and instrument configuration before
presenting music in a live setting.</p>
<p>In the tradition of technology-assisted performance and production,
sync and digital audio do present a challenge to the DJ craft. It is the
assertion of this paper that the challenge should result in the
evolution and growth, rather than the death, of DJing. While digital
audio removes some of the difficulties in sourcing and handling records,
and sync automates some of the DJ’s work in connecting tracks,
practitioner concerns over technology-assisted practice are only valid
where it is assumed that making a task easier necessarily results in a
loss of skill. If deployed in a two-turntable setup, where DJs simply
continue the work of connecting tracks made by other producers, sync
would certainly reduce the DJ’s cognitive load, but should that matter
to our ideas for quality in performance?</p>
<p>This paper presents an expanded view of the scope of DJing, where the
work of production and performance can be amalgamated. The modern
practice amounts to more than finding and connecting ready-made records;
it involves making new works and executing more elaborate real-time
combinations. Evidently, the DJ’s embodiment of authenticity and
virtuosity can also be amalgamated; the modern DJ can be a producer of
recorded musical works <em>and</em> a producer of live performance
works. Comparisons between <em>RTO</em> and <em>TLD</em> showed that
virtuosity and authenticity did not disappear as a result of sync, they
were demonstrated at different stages and in different ways.</p>
<p><em>RTO</em> demonstrated, and Hawtin continues to demonstrate, that
DJs can use sync as an opportunity to do <em>something else</em> and
<em>something more</em> in performance. New ways of DJing that explore
techniques and configurations previously impracticable are emerging as
more DJs redeploy the headspace and dexterity that is freed up by
utilising sync. When paired with a desire to pursue improvisatory
assemblage in a more fluid and immediate manner, the reduced cognitive
load offered by sync is offset by an increased cognitive capacity during
performance, and a front-loading of the work required to realise a more
elaborate set.</p>
<p><em>RTO</em> exemplified a modern approach to DJing that departs from
its historical conventions. At a technical level, utilising sync enabled
longer blends between less developed tracks that were distributed and
manipulated across an expanded track count. More broadly, and
considering how the performer combines technique and repertoire, sync
facilitated a greater degree of improvisation, and enabled deferral of
arranging and mixing—the realisation of a track—until the execution of a
set.</p>
<p>Through critical review of technique and repertoire both pre- and
post-sync, this paper outlines a series of technology-mediated
transitions. Set preparation shifted from record digging to production
and pre-production: new works were made to play, rather than made for
record store shelves. The new shape of materials necessitated a
reconfiguration of performance instruments. Matters of authenticity and
virtuosity were disconnected from the vinyl format, and the historical
methods for handling it, to an all-in-one offering: production and
performance merged. This correlates to a shift toward the laptop, an
instrument used to produce music, prepare for a set, and to
simultaneously play and record a performance. <em>RTO</em> also made use
of that same device to review the performance on a more analytical
level. As laptops become more powerful and their interfaces more
interactive, it is likely they will be used even more extensively in DJ
practice.</p>
<p>For those of us deciding how to align and assemble audio, and for
anyone watching and listening, these discoveries should inform future
views of DJ practice and the presentation of Electronic Dance Music.
With the SYNC button in front of most new DJs, many will learn to
perform with that technology enabled. A few might seek more of a
challenge, or some connection to the past, and will learn to play
records as a point of distinction. This choice between convenience and
manual control is reminiscent of driving a car, where features such as
automatic transmission, power steering and cruise control are
optional.</p>
<p>With sync enabled, DJs will be gig-ready in a shorter time. With more
DJs in the field, there will be more competition and more innovation.
The relentless emergence of new beat-making machines, sequencers and
groove boxes will encourage them to improvise with new compositions: to
loop, rearrange, edit and effect works in real-time. This trend is
already evident amongst next wave Techno DJs such as Amelie Lens and
Charlotte de Witte, each of whom “takes a totally new direction” with
the Pioneer RMX-1000 DJ effector and sampler ("RMX-1000 Professional DJ
effector &amp; sampler (black) - Pioneer DJ", n.d.). The difference
between existing works and exclusive performance works will blur
further, and just as a young Nicky Siano experimented on three
turntables in 1973, these modern DJs will be not so much
<em>playing</em> <em>records</em> as <em>making</em> <em>music</em>.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>In DJ parlance, ‘track’ usually refers to an arranged
work. Historically these were played from vinyl, then from CDs. The
advent of digital audio led to flexibility in the type and shape of
tracks that could be played. Here ‘track’ refers to audio played by DJs,
distinct from the track one might find on a Digital Audio Workstation
(DAW) – DJs and producers often refer to these discrete audio tracks as
‘stems’.<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back"

<li id="fn2"><p>Since then, Hawtin has moved to performing on a modified
ten-channel desk designed by his father, an Allen &amp; Heath
PLAYdifferently MODEL 1 "EX" with additional direct output modifications
on the extended rear panel.<a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back"

<li id="fn3"><p>The run-out groove prevents the needle from reaching the
record’s inner label by trapping it in a loop.<a href="#fnref3"
class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn4"><p>In fairness to records arranged according to the
sections form outlined in the previous paragraph, it is worth making a
distinction between a 1.8-second audio loop and a complete track.<a

<li id="fn5"><p>Mills played thirteen separate pieces of audio from
vinyl. These were presented as a single CD track, in this case labelled
a ‘segment’.<a href="#fnref5" class="footnote-back"
